Once the poet was walking down a road and then there was a diversion, there were
two different paths and he had to choose one out of them. The poet says that as he was
one person, he could travel on one road only. He had to choose one out of these two
roads. Yellow wood means a forest with leaves which are wearing out and they have
turned yellow in colour â€“ the season of autumn. It represents a world which is full of
people, where people have been living for many years. They represent people who are
older than the poet. The poet kept standing there and looked at the path very carefully
as far as he could see it. Before taking the path, he wanted to know how it was. Was it
suitable for him or not? He was able to see the path till from where it curved after
which it was covered with trees and was hidden. It happens in our life also when we
have choices, we have alternatives, but we have to choose only one out of them, we
take time to think about the pros and cons, whether it is suitable for us or not and only
then, we take a decision on what path we should choose.
